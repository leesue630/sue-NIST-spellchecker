# Sue's Spell Checker

This project is a part of making a thesaurus in which contains OAGIS terminologies. In order to achieve the spell correction function, we use [WordNet](http://wordnet.princeton.edu/) database.
    
## Wordnet Database
You can download the Wordnet data from [here](http://wordnetcode.princeton.edu/wn3.1.dict.tar.gz). As of today, the database version is 3.1. It should be located in data/wn31 if you don't want to change the default settings in 'extjwnl_resource_properties.xml'.
